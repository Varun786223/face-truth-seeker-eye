  - Audio (unnatural pauses, lip-sync)
  - Metadata examination
  - External verification (reverse image search, blockchain)

- **15+ Detection Methods**:
  - GAN fingerprinting
  - Eye blink analysis
  - Lip-sync analysis
  - And more...

- **User Customization**:
  - Adjustable sensitivity
  - Configurable detection settings
  - Drag-and-drop feature prioritization

- **Comprehensive Reporting**:
  - Detailed confidence scores
  - Exportable PDF reports
  - Visual result dashboards
